==============
Version 0.15.3
==============

* Add the 'runahead' property to RetroCore. This allow the core to
  output the video and audio of a future frame, allowing to compensate
  for input lag from the original hardware for console emulator cores.
* Options:
 - Make RetroOption public.
 - Add RetroOptionIterator to iterate over an option set.
 - Add retro_core_has_option(), retro_core_get_option() and retro_core_iterate_options().
 - core: Add 'options-set' signal
   It is emitted when the core initially sets the options during boot. This
   allows setting options that require being set before the core is
   initialized.
* Add RetroKeyJoypadMapping and let RetroCoreView use one to set its
  keyboard to virtual joypad mapping.
* Make RetroCoreView set default controllers only for actually supported
  capabilities and make RetroCoreViewController return only the
  capabilities matching its type.
* Add retro_joypad_id_to_button_code() and
  retro_joypad_id_from_button_code() to convert a Linux button event
  code into a RetroJoypadId and vice versa.
* Add RETRO_RUMBLE_EFFECT_COUNT, allowing to know the number of values
  of RetrormbleEffect.
* Libretro environment commands:
 - Implement RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_SET_GEOMETRY to allow cores to change
   aspect ratio separately from framerate.
 - Implement RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_LANGUAGE to allow cores to know the
   user's language.
 - Fix a missing return when setting the disk control interface, which
   let the cores think we don't support it.
* add documentation of what's unimplemented from Libretro, updated to retroarch 1.7.2
  Add UNIMPLEMENTED.md
    This documents which parts of Libretro are not yet implemented by
    retro-gtk.
* Tests:
 - Add the retro-reftest program allowing to easily run reference tests
   on Libretro cores, based on retro-gtk and test descriptor files.

  generate tests references
  Boot test
  Options
  FastForward test
  State None, State Refresh
  Run test
  Video test
  controllers and inputs
* Add retro-dummy dummy Libretro core, used to run unit tests and reference tests.
* Add RetroCore unit tests
* retro-demo will take params after the core to be medias to load into the core
* Fix various runtime warnings and potential crashes.
*
    build: Add options and slight cleanup

    Add the 'introspection', 'demos', 'build-tests' and 'install-tests'
    options allowing you to disable instrospection, demos and tests.

* improve some internal docs (keyboard key convertion)


==============
Version 0.14.0
==============

* Add dependency on libepoxy.
* RetroCoreView:
 - Render the video with OpenGL instead of Cairo.
 - Drop the 'pixbuf' property, bt keep the pixbuf accessor functions.
   This avoids an automatic and probably useless convertion of the video
   to a GdkPixbuf as it isn't part of the rendering pipeline anymore.
 - Grab the focus when clicked, avoiding to miss the player's keyboard
   events to control the game.
 - Allow it to be the default widget by default bt setting the
   'can-default' property to TRUE on construction.
* Add internal support for GLSL based video filters and port the
  existing ones to GLSL so they can work with the OpenGL renderer.
* Add RETRO_VIDEO_FILTER_CRT, a RetroVideoFilter demanding the video
  display to mimick a CRT TV screen.
* RetroPixdata:
 - Add retro_pixdata_get_width/height() and
   retro_pixdata_load_gl_texture(), allowing to export the pixel data to
   an OpenGL texture and to draw it at the expected size.
 - Don't fail when constructing with a non-zero rowstride, as these are
   valid values.
* Add the set_rumble_state() virtual method to RetroController and
  implement it in RetroCoreViewController.
* Build system change: make retro-gtk-demo properly depend on retro-gtk.
* The project moved to https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/retro-gtk.

* Bugs fixed:
 - https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790454

==============
Version 0.13.2
==============

* Port the build system to Meson, requiring version 0.43.0 and drop the
  Autotools.
* Drop retro_core_remove_controller(), to remove a controller instead
  set it to NULL.
* Make retro_core_poll_controllers(),
  retro_core_get_controller_input_state() and
  retro_core_get_controller_capabilities() private as they are meant to
  be used by the Libretro core and not the end users.
* Add retro_core_set_default_controller() to set controllers to be used
  by default when there is no controller with the requested capability
  in the requested port. Add retro_core_view_set_as_default_controller()
  to easily set the controllers of a RetroCoreView as the default
  controllers of a RetroCore. retro-demo now uses these.
* Add retro_controller_has_capability() to easily check if a controller
  has the given RetroControllerType capability.
* Add RetroInput to encapsulate the inputs used in an input state query.
  It is used in retro_controller_get_input_state() and
  retro_core_view_get_input_state().
* Replace gboolean by bool in get_variable_update() to avoid crashes.
* Add a count enumeration value to RetroControllerType and the various
  controller code enumerations.
* Better check the creation of the PuleAudio sound output to avoid
  crashes.

==============
Version 0.13.1
==============

This version ports retro-gtk from Vala to C and simnplifies the API a
lot. It comes with lots of API breaks, so many that it would be simpler
to list what remained similar to the 0.12 branch than what changed.

The API will keep changing during the 0.14 development cycle, but it is
hoped to lead to less API breaks after that.

Reviewers: given how much changed, consider this as a new librarby,
don't review it in comparison with its previous versions.

* Bugs fixed:
 782501 retro-gtk: Port to C
 787548 mGBA fails to save memory
 787769 retro-gtk: Keyboard keys can be stuck

===============
Version 0.11.92
===============

* Core:
 - Remove the barely used system-info property.
 - Use Gdk.EventKey for keyboard inputs.
 - Make the init singal an error-throwing method.
 - Implement disk handling directly.

* CoreView can be exposed as a joypad, a mouse or a pointer.

* retro-demo:
 - Add pointer support from CoreView.

* Make all error domains internal.

* Make internal and port to C:
 - GameInfo.
 - Module.
 - SystemAvInfo.
 - SystemInfo.
 - most of Core.
 - keyboard keys.

* Remove unused symbols:
 - DiskControl.
 - GamepadConfiguration.
 - GamepadButtonType.
 - Keyboard.
 - KeyboardState.
 - MemDesc.
 - MemoryDescriptor.
 - MemoryMap.
 - Mouse.

==============
Version 0.11.4
==============

* A demo application has been added, it allows to directly test the

* Loading games:
 - Add the set_medias(), load_medias() and set_current_media() methods
   to Core and load the given medias (if any) in Core.init().
 - Remove load_game() and prepare() Core methods from the public API as
   they are now used indirectly.
 - This should simplify loading games for the users of the library.

* Logging:
 - Add the Core.log() signal which will emit a GLib compatible logging
   message with the Libretro core's name as the log domain.
 - Add retro_g_log() to simply handle Core.log() by outputing the logs
   in the expected unstructured GLib fashion.
 - Remove LogLevel, Log and FileStreamLog as they are now useless.

* Add CoreView as a prototype of a single widget to handle most inputs
  and outputs of a core and use it in the demo.
